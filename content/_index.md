# Browsers

**Browsers** is an intuitive context menu that pops up when you press a link in an app other than a web browser.

- Does not run in the background
- Non-obtrusive design, looking more like a context menu
- Supports user profiles for browsers based on Chrome and Firefox
- Supports Firefox containers (also need [Open external links in a container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-url-in-container/) extension installed until [#1726634](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1726634) is resolved)
- Runs on Mac and Linux (Windows is also considered if there is interest)

# Installation

Download for your platform

 - macOS - [**Browsers.dmg**](https://github.com/Browsers-software/browsers/releases/latest/download/Browsers.dmg) (Apple Silicon and Intel based Macs)
 - Linux - [**browsers_linux.tar.gz**](https://github.com/Browsers-software/browsers/releases/latest/download/browsers_linux.tar.gz) (arm64 and x86_64)
